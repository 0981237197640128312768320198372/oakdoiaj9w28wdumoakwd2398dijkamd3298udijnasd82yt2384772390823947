# Mandatory LINE Verification System for Seller Registration

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a mandatory LINE verification system that prevents
seller account creation until successful verification is completed.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **New Pending Registration Model** (`models/v3/PendingRegistration.ts`)

- Created a temporary storage system for registration data
- Stores all seller information before verification
- Includes TTL (Time To Live) for automatic cleanup
- Prevents database pollution with unverified accounts

### 2. **Modified Registration API** (`app/api/v3/seller/register/route.ts`)

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: No longer creates seller accounts immediately
- Creates pending registration record instead
- Returns verification code and pending ID
- Includes clear warning about mandatory verification

### 3. **Enhanced LINE Webhook** (`app/api/v3/line/webhook/route.ts`)

- Handles pending registration verification
- Creates actual seller account only after successful LINE verification
- Automatically cleans up pending registration after account creation
- Maintains existing functionality for already verified sellers

### 4. **Updated Frontend** (`components/public/store/RegisterSellerPage.tsx`)

- Added mandatory verification warning
- Updated TypeScript interfaces for new response format
- Clear messaging that account creation depends on verification
- Improved user experience with verification status tracking

## New Flow

### Before (Problem)

1. User submits registration form
2. ‚úÖ Seller account created in database
3. Verification code generated
4. User may or may not verify
5. ‚ùå Unverified accounts exist in database

### After (Solution)

1. User submits registration form
2. ‚è≥ Pending registration created (NOT seller account)
3. Verification code generated
4. **User MUST verify via LINE**
5. ‚úÖ Only after verification ‚Üí Seller account created
6. üßπ Pending registration cleaned up

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ **True Mandatory Verification**

- No way to bypass or skip verification
- Account creation is completely blocked without verification

### ‚úÖ **Clean Database**

- No orphaned/unverified seller records
- Automatic cleanup of expired pending registrations

### ‚úÖ **Better Security**

- Ensures all sellers have valid LINE accounts
- Prevents spam registrations

### ‚úÖ **No API Spamming**

- Single webhook handles all verification logic
- Efficient processing without multiple API calls

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```typescript
// Pending Registration (Temporary)
{
  username: string,
  email: string,
  password: string, // hashed
  contact: ContactData,
  store: StoreData,
  verification: {
    code: string,
    expiresAt: Date,
    attempts: number
  },
  lineUserId?: string,
  expiresAt: Date // TTL for cleanup
}

// Seller (Only created after verification)
{
  // ... existing seller fields
  verification: {
    status: 'verified', // Always verified
    verifiedAt: Date,
    // ...
  }
}
```

### API Responses

```typescript
// Registration Response (New)
{
  message: "Registration initiated. Please verify your LINE account to complete registration.",
  verificationCode: "ABC123",
  expiresAt: "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  requiresLineVerification: true,
  pendingId: "pending_registration_id",
  warning: "Account will only be created after successful LINE verification."
}
```

### Verification Process

1. **Registration**: Creates pending record, returns verification code
2. **LINE Message**: User sends code to LINE bot
3. **Webhook Processing**:
   - Finds pending registration by code
   - Creates actual seller account
   - Cleans up pending registration
   - Sends success message

## Error Handling

### Expired Verification

- Pending registrations auto-expire after 30 minutes
- TTL index automatically removes expired records
- Users must restart registration process

### Failed Verification

- Invalid codes return error message
- No account creation occurs
- Pending registration remains until expiry

### Duplicate Registrations

- Checks for existing sellers with same email/username
- Removes any existing pending registration for retry
- Prevents conflicts between pending and actual accounts

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing verified sellers remain unaffected
- Old verification codes still work for already created accounts
- No data migration required

### Frontend Changes

- Registration flow now includes mandatory verification step
- Clear messaging about verification requirement
- Updated TypeScript interfaces

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Passwords are hashed before storing in pending registrations
- Sensitive data automatically cleaned up after verification
- TTL prevents long-term storage of unverified data

### Verification Security

- Verification codes have expiration times
- Limited verification attempts
- Secure LINE webhook signature validation

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Cleanup

- Automatic cleanup via MongoDB TTL indexes
- No manual intervention required
- Prevents database bloat

### Logging

- All verification attempts logged
- Pending registration creation/cleanup tracked
- Error handling with detailed logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Registration Flow**

   - Verify pending registration creation
   - Confirm no seller account created initially

2. **Test Verification**

   - Valid code creates seller account
   - Invalid code returns error
   - Expired code prevents account creation

3. **Test Cleanup**

   - Expired pending registrations removed
   - Successful verification cleans up pending record

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Duplicate email/username handling
   - Network failures during verification
   - Concurrent verification attempts

## Conclusion

The mandatory verification system ensures that:

- ‚úÖ **No accounts are created without verification**
- ‚úÖ **Database remains clean and organized**
- ‚úÖ **Security is enhanced through verified LINE accounts**
- ‚úÖ **User experience is clear and guided**

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly verification system that prevents
spam and ensures all sellers have valid LINE accounts.
